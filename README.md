## Cats vs Dogs Classification using SVM

#Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal is to build a model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project: Dogs vs Cats Dataset. (It includes a large number of labeled images of cats and dogs.)

#Results
The SVM model was trained and tested on a subset of the dataset. The classifier successfully distinguished between images of cats and dogs, providing a baseline for further improvements.

#Key Learnings
1. The fundamentals of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and their application in image classification.
2. Data preprocessing techniques, including image resizing and scaling.
3. Handling imbalanced classes in image datasets.
4. Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
